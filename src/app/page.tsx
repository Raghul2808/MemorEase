  {
    question: "How does MemorEase work?",
    answer:
      "MemorEase uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze your uploaded PDFs or pasted text. It identifies key concepts, definitions, and important terms, then automatically generates flashcards and reviewer notes tailored to your content.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is MemorEase free to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes! MemorEase is completely free to use. You get 10 AI generations per day, which resets daily. There's no credit card required, no hidden fees, and no premium tier that locks essential features.",
  },
  {
    question: "What file formats does MemorEase support?",
    answer:
      "MemorEase supports PDF files and plain text. You can either upload a PDF document or paste text directly into the editor. We're working on adding support for more formats like DOCX and images.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the gamification system work?",
    answer:
      "Every study action earns you XP - completing flashcard sessions, taking practice tests, maintaining study streaks, and more. As you accumulate XP, you level up and unlock achievements that track your learning milestones.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share my study materials?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! You can generate shareable links for any of your flashcard decks or reviewers. Anyone with the link can view and study from your materials without needing an account.",
